## üìê Style Guidelines

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ modern JavaScript
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Handle errors gracefully

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate derived statistics for a character
 * @param {Object} systemData - The character's system data
 * @returns {Object} Updated system data with calculated values
 */
_calculateDerivedStats(systemData) {
  // Clear, descriptive implementation
}
```

### HTML/Handlebars
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow existing template patterns
- Include accessibility attributes
- Use consistent indentation

```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="trait-value">Trait Value</label>
  <input type="number" name="trait.value" id="trait-value" value="{{trait.value}}" />
</div>
```

### CSS
- Use existing CSS classes when possible
- Follow BEM-like naming conventions
- Include responsive design considerations
- Comment complex selectors

```css
/* Trait display in character sheet */
.daggerheart .trait-display {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 10px;
}
```

### JSON
- Use consistent formatting
- Include all required fields
- Add comments where helpful (in JS files that generate JSON)

## üß™ Testing

## üîÑ Release Process

This project uses **automated releases** through GitHub Actions to ensure consistent packaging and distribution.

### Version Numbers
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Major: Breaking changes
- Minor: New features, backwards compatible  
- Patch: Bug fixes

### Creating a Release

1. **Prepare for Release**
   - Ensure all changes are merged to `main` branch
   - Update version in `system.json` 
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version details
   - Test thoroughly in FoundryVTT

2. **Create Release on GitHub**
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/gmtoolkit/foundry-dragonheart/releases)
   - Click "Create a new release"
   - Create a new tag (e.g., `v1.1.0`)
   - Title the release (e.g., "Version 1.1.0 - Feature Description")
   - Write release notes describing changes
   - Click "Publish release"

3. **Automated Process**
   - GitHub Actions automatically triggers on release creation
   - Updates `system.json` with correct version and download URLs
   - Creates `system.zip` with all necessary files (excluding dev files)
   - Attaches both `system.json` and `system.zip` to the release
   - Updates the `latest` release tag

### Release Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated  
- [ ] Version numbers incremented in `system.json`
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated with new version
- [ ] License compliance verified (Any SRD content must comply with [DPCGL](https://darringtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DRP-CGL-May-19-2025.pdf) and software released under MIT license)
- [ ] Release created with proper tag and description
- [ ] Automated build completed successfully
- [ ] Manual verification of release artifacts

### Automated Release Files

The GitHub Action creates these files automatically:

- **`system.json`**: Manifest with updated version and URLs
- **`system.zip`**: Complete system package excluding development files

**Files Excluded from Release** (see `.github/zip-exclude.lst`):
- Git files and history
- Development tools and configs  
- IDE files
- Temporary and cache files
- Test files
- Documentation source files (CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)

### Rollback Process

If a release has issues:
1. **Hot Fix**: Create a patch release with fixes
2. **Revert**: Delete the problematic release and recreate  
3. **Emergency**: Manually edit release artifacts if needed

### Release Notifications

- Releases are visible on the GitHub repository
- Users get automatic updates through FoundryVTT's system updater
- Community can be notified through Discord/forums as appropriate

## üìû Getting Help

### Questions and Support
